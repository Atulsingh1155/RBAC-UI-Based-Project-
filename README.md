Here’s a detailed README.md for the RBAC Dashboard application that you can use to explain the project and guide users through setup, development, and usage.

RBAC Dashboard
Overview
The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Dashboard is a modern React application that allows administrators to manage users, roles, and permissions. It provides a secure and user-friendly interface to handle user management, role assignment, and permission configuration, making it ideal for applications that require different levels of access control based on user roles.

Core Features:
User Management: Add, edit, or delete users and assign them to different roles.
Role Management: Create and edit roles, and assign specific permissions (Read, Write, Delete).
Dynamic Permissions: Easily assign or modify permissions for roles.
Custom API Simulation (Optional): Simulate API calls for CRUD operations on users and roles.

Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14.x or above)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Steps to Setup the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Atulsingh1155/rbac-dashboard.git
cd rbac-dashboard
Install dependencies:

This will install the required dependencies defined in package.json.

bash
Copy code
npm install
Development
Running the Application in Development Mode
To run the application in development mode, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start a development server using react-scripts and open the application in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router: Library for handling routing and navigation within the app.
Material UI: React components for building a responsive and attractive UI.
Axios: Library for making HTTP requests (mocked for this project).
React-scripts: A tool to help set up and run the React application.
Dependencies
Here are the main dependencies that power the RBAC dashboard:

React: For building the user interface.
Material UI: For styling and ready-to-use components.
React Router: For handling routing between different pages like User Management, Role Management, etc.
Axios: For making API requests to simulate fetching user and role data.
Running the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will:

Launch the app on http://localhost:3000.
Provide features like adding users, assigning roles, editing roles, and displaying permissions dynamically.
